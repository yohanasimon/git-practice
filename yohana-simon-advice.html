                <h4>Keep Practicing!</h4>
                <p>Learn programming might be hard, but just believe in yourself, be consistent, don't give up, keep practicing, you'll find it easy later :)</p>
                <h4>Build Patience</h4>
                <p>Patience can help you become a better problem-solver, and improve your understanding of computers.
                <h4>Set a Goal</h4>
                <p>There is no end to learning and improvement in programming, and thatâ€™s why it is a good idea to keep setting goals, and not to lose track of your primary goal.</p>
